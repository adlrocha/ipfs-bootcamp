# ipfs-bootcamp

## Content
A good way to get started with the Web3 stack.
- [Day 1: The IPFS Stack (I)](./day1)
- [Day 2: The IPFS Stack (II)](./day2)
- [Day 3: Filecoin](./day3)
- [Day 4: Tools and ecosystem applications](./day4)
- [Day 5: Building a use case](./day5)

## Logistics
- First things first, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/adlrocha/ipfs-bootcamp
```
- The bootcamp is highly practical, I expect everyone to try running the code,
install the tech, and do the exercise. Enjoy the ride!
- The distribution of topics per day and time per slot are indicative.
We can go as deep as you want in the topics listed.
- The goal of the workshop is for you to leave with a good understanding
of the Web3 stack, and to have the makings of a project that uses IPFS.
- This is a "self-served" bootcamp, I've collected an extensive pool
of topics and technologies for you to choose the ones you are more interested
in (leaving the rest for future reference).
- If there is a specific topic or question I don't know, I'll take it as a home
assignment, find the solution, and give it to you the next day.
- If something doesn't work, one step has changed, or there has been an update,
file an issue and/or a PR.
- And give AS MUCH FEEDBACK AS YOU CAN. These technologies are still young
and they would appreciate your love :)
- You have questions/ideas/suggestions? Open a [discussion](https://github.com/adlrocha/ipfs-bootcamp/discussions) topic.
- 1h sessions with 15 min break or 2h sessions with 30 min break?
